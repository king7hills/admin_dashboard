TOP Admin Dashboard Project

Project Start Date: 1.19.25

Created the basic sections with their corresponding colors. Added icons and started filling in some content. Much to be done still.

1.21.25
Completed the dashboard for now. Everything is styled to a workable/acceptable level.
There is no javascript currently, but that will be added in the future. For now, the assignment is completed
and major progress has been made on the application including branding, base color scheme (I want to create a dark mode scheme using blues and grays),
goal implementations, etc.

This was an awesome project, and I am very humbled by how much work goes into styling and creating beautiful responsive websites.
